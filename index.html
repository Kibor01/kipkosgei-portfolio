          <h2>Welcome To My Website</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Kipkosgei I want to share a brief story about my journey as a
            web developer. The journey started because of my passion in wanting
            to know about technolog y and it's evolving nature. I was also
            inspired by
            <a href="https://raasissoftware.com/" target="_blank"
              >Ra'Asis Software</a
            >
            especially how they dedicate there time on projects and also a place
            where mentorship and good coaching is priority. Hence making
            learning more easier.My passion for web development began with a
            fascination for how websites are built and evolved into a deep
            commitment to crafting engaging, user-friendly digital experiences.
            As a front-end developer, I’ve dedicated myself to mastering HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, and continuously explore frameworks like React
            to stay ahead in a fast-paced industry. From building my first
            static webpage to developing dynamic, responsive interfaces, every
            step of my journey has been driven by curiosity and a desire to
            bring creative ideas to life through code. Web development is more
            than a career for me—it's a craft I’m genuinely passionate about.

            <h4>Web Designer</h4>
            Create responsive and aesthetic layouts using HTML and CSS.
            Translate wireframes, mockups, or design briefs into functional web
            interfaces. Implement mobile-first and cross-browser designs that
            enhance user experience. 2. Front-End Development Use HTML to
            structure the content of web pages semantically and accessibly.
            Style components using CSS, including Flexbox, Grid, animations, and
            preprocessors like SASS if needed. Add interactivity and dynamic
            behaviors through JavaScript, handling events, DOM manipulation, API
            integration, and animations.

            <h4>Front End Developer</h4>
            UI/UX Implementation Convert design mockups (from tools like Figma,
            Sketch, or Adobe XD) into functional web pages. Ensure consistent
            layout, styling, and responsiveness across devices and screen sizes.
            HTML/CSS/JavaScript Coding Write clean, semantic HTML for content
            structure. Use CSS/SCSS for styling, animations, and responsive
            design. Use JavaScript (and frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular)
            to add interactivity. 3. Performance Optimization Optimize front-end
            code for speed and efficiency (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting).
            Minimize and compress assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
            4. Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility Ensure the website
            functions properly on all modern browsers and devices. Use tools and
            techniques to fix bugs specific to different environments.

            <h4>Web Design (React)</h4>
            Responsive Design with Conditional Rendering React allows UI
            elements to be shown or hidden based on screen size, user actions,
            or data. Combined with CSS frameworks or libraries (like Tailwind or
            Styled Components), React helps create responsive, adaptive layouts.
            5. Integration with Design Systems and Libraries Easily integrates
            with UI libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design, etc.) to quickly
            implement professional-looking designs. Also supports custom themes
            and styles for brand consistency. 6. Improved Developer Experience =
            Better Design React’s component-based structure and tooling (like
            hot reloading) allow for rapid design prototyping and iteration.
            Designers and developers can collaborate more effectively, improving
            design quality and speed.
