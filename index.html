            <h2>Hello! I'm Kipkosgei</h2>
            <p>
                As I embark on my journey into the world of web design and emerging technologies, I found myself 
                drawn into this territory where creativity is brought together with innovation and 
                every line of code holds potential to shape the digital landscape of tomorrow.
                As I navigate through this ever-changing landscape, I realize that learning in web design and 
                emerging technologies is not just about acquiring technical skills its about cultivating a 
                mindset of curiosity and continuous growth.
