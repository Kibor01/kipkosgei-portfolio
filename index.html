          <h2>Hello There, Welcome To My Website</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Kipkosgei, I want to share a brief story about my journey as a
            web developer. The journey started because of my passion in wanting
            to know about technology and it's evolving nature. I was also
            inspired by
            <a href="https://raasissoftware.com/" target="_blank"
              >Ra'Asis Software</a
            >, especially how they dedicate there time on projects, mentorship
            and good coaching. Hence making learning easier. My passion for web
            development began with a fascination for how websites are built and
            evolved into a deep commitment to crafting engaging, user-friendly
            digital experiences. As a front-end developer, I’ve dedicated myself
            to mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and continuously explore
            frameworks like React to stay ahead in a fast-paced industry. From
            building my first static webpage to developing dynamic, responsive
            interfaces, every step of my journey has been driven by curiosity
            and a desire to bring creative ideas to life through code. Web
            development is more than a career for me, it's a craft I’m genuinely
            passionate about.

            <h4>Web Design</h4>
            <p>
              Create responsive and aesthetic layouts using HTML and CSS.
              Translate wireframes, mockups, or design briefs into functional
              web interfaces. Implement mobile-first and cross-browser designs
              that enhance user experience. 2. Front-End Development Use HTML to
              structure the content of web pages semantically and accessibly.
              Style components using CSS, including Flexbox, Grid, animations,
              and preprocessors like SASS if needed. Add interactivity and
              dynamic behaviors through JavaScript, handling events, DOM
              manipulation, API integration, and animations.

            <h4>Front End Development</h4>
            <p>
              UI/UX Implementation Convert design mockups (from tools like
              Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD) into functional web pages. Ensure
              consistent layout, styling, and responsiveness across devices and
              screen sizes. HTML/CSS/JavaScript Coding Write clean, semantic
              HTML for content structure. Use CSS/SCSS for styling, animations,
              and responsive design. Use JavaScript (and frameworks like React,
              Vue, or Angular) to add interactivity. 3. Performance Optimization
              Optimize front-end code for speed and efficiency (e.g., lazy
              loading, code splitting). Minimize and compress assets like
              images, CSS, and JavaScript files. 4. Cross-Browser and
              Cross-Device Compatibility Ensure the website functions properly
              on all modern browsers and devices. Use tools and techniques to
              fix bugs specific to different environments.

            <h4>Web Design (React)</h4>
            <p>
              Responsive Design with Conditional Rendering React allows UI
              elements to be shown or hidden based on screen size, user actions,
              or data. Combined with CSS frameworks or libraries (like Tailwind
              or Styled Components), React helps create responsive, adaptive
              layouts. 5. Integration with Design Systems and Libraries Easily
              integrates with UI libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design, etc.) to
              quickly implement professional-looking designs. Also supports
              custom themes and styles for brand consistency. 6. Improved
              Developer Experience = Better Design React’s component-based
              structure and tooling (like hot reloading) allow for rapid design
              prototyping and iteration. Designers and developers can
              collaborate more effectively, improving design quality and speed.

                Working as part of a collaborative web development team, I
                contributed to designing and building a multi-page website using

              <p>
                In this project, I worked with a team to enhance the visual
                design and user experience of an existing website. I focused on
                CSS styling, layout adjustments, color schemes, animations, and
                improving readability. Collaborating with other members helped
                me understand design feedback, version control, and the
                importance of aligning individual contributions with the overall
                project goals. This experience strengthened my creativity,
